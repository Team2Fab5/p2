Neighborly is an app that wants to make the world smaller and friendlier. 

It connects users that are within one mile of each other who need something done.  

Imagine our neighbor Agnes needs to have her walk shoveled. She makes a request and her neighbor Paul sees it. Paul can then take the task and help with shoveling.  Agnes can also see a task later, say help potting flowers.  Agnes can help Paul later. 

Neighborly takes the impulse to do good, and makes it even easier.  

The user will make an account with their username, email and password. This is done via passport. This will then be saved so they can make tasks to be done. There will also be completed tasks, and neighbors that are near them. 

In the future we hope to make a ranking system. 

The technology used: Google Maps API, Passport, MySQL, Node and Express.
